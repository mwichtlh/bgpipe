Below are practical examples to help you get started with  `bgpipe`  after you went through the [quickstart guide](quickstart.md). These examples demonstrate how to use  `bgpipe`  for various BGP-related tasks, such as connecting to BGP speakers, reading MRT files, filtering messages, and more.

## Connect to a BGP speaker

Connect to a BGP speaker and respond to OPEN message using the same ASN. Note that if an IP address is used as a stage, it is a shorthand for `connect <ip>`. The command dumps the session in JSON format to stdout, since the `-o` option is enabled. It's useful for debugging and monitoring BGP sessions, allowing you to see the raw BGP messages.

```bash
bgpipe -o speaker -- 1.2.3.4
```

## JSON to BGP and back

Convert a JSON input file to BGP messages, send them to a BGP speaker, and capture the output back in JSON format. This example is useful for testing BGP message processing in remote speakers.

```bash
cat input.json \
  | bgpipe -io speaker -- 1.2.3.4 \
  | tee output.json
```

## Convert MRT files to JSON

Read MRT updates from a compressed file and convert the updates to JSON format. This is particularly useful for analyzing historical BGP data stored in MRT files, which are often used for archiving BGP updates.

```bash
bgpipe \
  -- read --mrt updates.20230301.0000.bz2 \
  -- write output.json
```

## Adding TCP-MD5

Set up a proxy that listens on TCP port 179, waits for a connection, and then proxies it to `1.2.3.4` with a [popular](https://www.theregister.com/2020/12/16/solarwinds_github_password/) TCP-MD5 password. The conversation is printed to stdout. This setup is useful for "securing" BGP sessions, ensuring that only authorized peers can establish a TCP connection. It supports multi-hop scenarios.

```bash
bgpipe -o \
  -- listen :179 \
  -- connect --wait listen --md5 solarwinds123 1.2.3.4
```

## Stream MRT files to BGP routers

Listen for new connections on TCP port 179. Configure an active BGP speaker for `AS65055` that streams a given MRT file when the BGP session is established. This example demonstrates how to replay historical BGP data in a live BGP session, which can be useful for testing and analysis.

```bash
bgpipe \
  -- speaker --active --asn 65055 \
  -- read --mrt --wait ESTABLISHED updates.20230301.0000.bz2 \
  -- listen :179
```

## BGP sed-in-the-middle proxy

Create a BGP proxy that connects `1.2.3.4` with [85.232.240.179](https://lukasz.bromirski.net/post/bgp-w-labie-3/), but rewrites ASNs in their OPEN messages using [sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed). This is useful for quickly testing and modifying BGP sessions on the fly, allowing you to simulate different network scenarios.

```bash
bgpipe \
  -- connect 1.2.3.4 \
  -- exec -LR --args sed -ure '/"OPEN"/{ s/65055/65001/g; s/57355/65055/g }' \
  -- connect 85.232.240.179
```

## Applying prefix limits

Filter BGP updates based on prefix lengths and enforce maximum prefix session limits for both IPv4 and IPv6 connections. This helps in managing and securing BGP sessions by limiting the number of prefixes, which can prevent [resource exhaustion](https://kirin-attack.github.io/).

```bash
bgpipe --kill limit/session \
  -- connect 1.2.3.4 \
  -- limit -LR --ipv4 --min-length  8 --max-length 24 --session 1000000 \
  -- limit -LR --ipv6 --min-length 16 --max-length 48 --session 250000 \
  -- connect 5.6.7.8
```

## Archive BGP sessions over encrypted WebSockets

Stream the BGP session log in JSON format to a remote WebSocket server for real-time monitoring and archiving. This is useful for integrating BGP session data with external monitoring systems, providing a live feed of BGP activity.

```bash
bgpipe \
  -- connect 1.2.3.4 \
  -- websocket -LR --write wss://bgpfix.com/archive?user=demo \
  -- connect 85.232.240.179
```

## Grep for BGP messages in live sessions

Proxy a connection between two BGP peers, allowing only IPv6 updates from origin AS `12345`. This is useful for environments that wish to only accept IPv6 prefixes from a specific ASN. The `grep` stage allows for [complex filtering](./filters.md) based on various criteria such as message type, prefix, AS_PATH, and more.

```bash
bgpipe \
  -- connect 1.2.3.4 \
  -- grep 'ipv6 && as_origin = 12345' \
  -- connect 85.232.240.179
```

## ExaBGP compatibility

Use the `--exa` flag to read and write [ExaBGP](https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exabgp) line format instead of JSON. This allows integration with existing ExaBGP-based scripts and tools.

```bash
# Process BGP messages with an ExaBGP-compatible script
bgpipe \
  -- connect 1.2.3.4 \
  -- exec --exa -LR --args /path/to/script.py \
  -- connect 5.6.7.8

# Convert JSON to ExaBGP format
cat session.json | bgpipe stdin -- stdout --exa
```
