## Installation

To get started with `bgpipe`, you need to install it on your system, ie. where you want it to proxy or terminate BGP sessions. `bgpipe` is a single binary that can be run on any machine with a compatible operating system (preferably Linux). It does not require any additional libraries or dependencies, making it easy to deploy - just copy the binary to your target machine.

You can download pre-built binaries from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/bgpfix/bgpipe/releases/latest):

```bash
wget https://github.com/bgpfix/bgpipe/releases/latest/download/bgpipe-linux-amd64
chmod +x bgpipe-linux-amd64
sudo mv -f bgpipe-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/bgpipe   # note (1)
```

1. Make sure that the target directory is in your `$PATH`, or simply rename the binary to `bgpipe` and keep executing it from the current directory.

Alternatively, you can compile from source. You need to have [Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install) first. Then, you can run:

```bash
go install github.com/bgpfix/bgpipe@latest   # note (1)
```

1. Make sure to put the resultant `bgpipe` binary in your `$PATH`. Go installs executables in the directory named by the `$GOBIN` environment variable, which defaults to `$GOPATH/bin`, or `$HOME/go/bin` if the `$GOPATH` variable is not set.

## Running bgpipe

When you run `bgpipe` without any arguments, it will print the help message, for example:

```

From the above output, you can learn the basic syntax of a *pipeline*, which is a sequence of *stages*. Usually the stages are separated by `--` characters; otherwise, `bgpipe` will try to separate the stages automatically, although this can lead to ambiguities for more complex pipelines. Global `bgpipe` options are specified before the first stage, and options for each stage are specified immediately after the stage name.

A *stage* is a specific processing step in the pipeline, such as connecting to a BGP endpoint, filtering messages, or executing a command. You can think of it as a building block that performs a specific task in the overall message processing flow. In order to learn more about a specific stage, you can run `bgpipe <stage> -h`, for example:

```
$ bgpipe connect -h
Stage usage: connect [OPTIONS] ADDR

Description: connect to a BGP endpoint over TCP

Options:
      --timeout duration   connect timeout (0 means none) (default 1m0s)
      --closed duration    half-closed timeout (0 means none) (default 1s)
      --md5 string         TCP MD5 password

Common Options:
  -L, --left               operate in the L direction
  -R, --right              operate in the R direction
  -A, --args               consume all CLI arguments till --
  -W, --wait strings       wait for given event before starting
  -S, --stop strings       stop after given event is handled
  -N, --new string         which stage to send new messages to (default "next")
  -O, --of string          stage output filter (drop non-matching output)
```

As you can see, the `connect` stage has its own set of options, such as `--timeout`, `--closed`, and `--md5`, which are specific to establishing a BGP connection. The common options, such as `-L`, `-R`, etc. are available for all stages and control how the stage operates in the pipeline context.

By default, all stages operate in the *right* (`-R`) direction, meaning that they process BGP messages flowing from left to right. The direction controls which messages to capture for processing in a stage, and where to send new messages. However, if the last stage connects to a BGP endpoint, by default it will operate in the *left* (`-L`) direction, meaning it will send new messages to the left of the pipeline. Usually, the left-most and/or right-most stage is the one that connects to a BGP endpoint, while the other stages process messages in between. If you want bidirectional processing, use the `-L` and `-R` options together, ie. `-LR`.

For writing BGP message filters used by the `grep` and `drop` stages, see the dedicated [filter reference](filters.md) with attributes, operators, and examples.

## Reading MRT files

Let's demonstrate basic message processing by reading MRT files. MRT files are a standard format for storing BGP messages, and `bgpipe` can read them from a file or a URL. You can even stream MRT files directly from the [RIPE NCC RIS](https://ris.ripe.net/docs/mrt/) or [RouteViews](https://archive.routeviews.org/) archives.

Below is an example of reading a compressed MRT file from the RIPE NCC RIS archive, filtering it for a specific prefix, and printing the results to stdout:

```json
$ bgpipe \
    -- read --mrt https://data.ris.ripe.net/rrc01/latest-update.gz \
    -- grep 'prefix ~ 8.0.0.0/8' \
    -- stdout
2025-07-04 13:17:47 INF streaming https://data.ris.ripe.net/rrc01/latest-update.gz stage="[1] read"
["R",6826,"2025-07-04T13:05:19.000",74,"UPDATE",{"reach":["8.20.247.0/24","8.26.56.0/24","104.37.179.0/24","199.167.65.0/24"],"attrs":{"ORIGIN":{"flags":"T","value":"IGP"},"ASPATH":{"flags":"T","value":[8218,174,20473,23393]},"NEXTHOP":{"flags":"T","value":"5.57.80.210"},"MED":{"flags":"O","value":4},"COMMUNITY":{"flags":"OT","value":["8218:102","8218:20000","8218:20110"]}}},{"PEER_AS":"8218","PEER_IP":"5.57.80.210","LOCAL_AS":"12654","LOCAL_IP":"5.57.80.4"}]
["R",7431,"2025-07-04T13:05:21.000",77,"UPDATE",{"reach":["8.20.247.0/24","8.26.56.0/24","104.37.179.0/24","199.167.65.0/24"],"attrs":{"ORIGIN":{"flags":"T","value":"IGP"},"ASPATH":{"flags":"T","value":[8218,20473,23393]},"NEXTHOP":{"flags":"T","value":"5.57.80.210"},"MED":{"flags":"O","value":4},"COMMUNITY":{"flags":"OT","value":["8218:102","8218:20000","8218:20110"]},"OTC":{"flags":"OTP","value":"0x00001a79"}}},{"LOCAL_AS":"12654","LOCAL_IP":"5.57.80.4","PEER_AS":"8218","PEER_IP":"5.57.80.210"}]
// ...
```

In the above, the `read` stage streams the latest BGP updates from the `rrc01` RIPE RIS collector, uncompresses the data on the fly, and sends back to the pipeline for further processing. Next, the `grep` stage captures these messages, applies a BGP message filter (IP prefix must overlap with the `8.0.0.0/8` IPv4 prefix), and sends accepted messages to the next stage (non-matching traffic is dropped). Finally, the `stdout` stage converts the messages to JSON format and prints them to stdout. See [filters](filters.md) for more filter examples and details.

`bgpipe` provides the `--explain` (short `-n`) debugging option that prints the pipeline as configured, but without actually running anything. For example:

```json
$ bgpipe -n \
    -- read --mrt https://data.ris.ripe.net/rrc01/latest-update.gz \
    -- grep 'prefix ~ 8.0.0.0/8' \
    -- stdout
--> MESSAGES FLOWING RIGHT -->
  [1] read --mrt https://data.ris.ripe.net/rrc01/latest-update.gz
      writes messages to pipeline inputs=1
  [2] grep prefix ~ 8.0.0.0/8
      reads messages from pipeline callbacks=1 types=[ALL]
  [3] stdout
      reads messages from pipeline callbacks=1 types=[ALL]

<-- MESSAGES FLOWING LEFT <--
  (none)
```

Last but not least, instead of putting the `stdout` stage explicitly in the pipeline, you can use the `--stdout` (short `-o`) option to `bgpipe`, in order to print BGP messages to stdout automatically. It will print all messages that make it to the very end of the left-hand side *and* right-hand side of the pipeline, ie. all messages that are not dropped by any stage.

```json
$ bgpipe -o \
    -- read --mrt https://data.ris.ripe.net/rrc01/latest-update.gz \
    -- grep 'prefix ~ 8.0.0.0/8'
...
```

## Connecting to a BGP speaker

Now that you know how to read MRT files, let's connect to a BGP speaker and process messages in real-time. You can use the `connect` stage to establish the TCP connection, and the `speaker` stage to open and maintain a BGP session.

We will use this opportunity to connect to one of [the BGP projects run by Łukasz Bromirski](https://lukasz.bromirski.net/projects/). The following command connects to the [BGP Blackholing with Flowspec endpoint](https://lukasz.bromirski.net/bgp-fs-blackholing/) and prints the conversation to stdout, which demonstrates that `bgpipe` supports [Flowspec](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8955):

```json
$ bgpipe -o \
    -- speaker --active --asn 65055 \

## Proxying BGP sessions

Finally, let's see how to use `bgpipe` to proxy BGP sessions. You can use the `listen` stage to accept incoming connections and the `connect` stage to forward BGP messages to another router. This allows you to create a transparent proxy that can filter, modify, or log BGP messages.

For example, let's use the [Vultr's BGP feature](https://docs.vultr.com/configuring-bgp-on-vultr), where you already have a local BIRD instance running on a VM, with the following configuration:

```
log syslog all;
router id 1.2.3.4;

protocol bgp vultr
{
  local as 123;
  source address 1.2.3.4;
  ipv4 {
    import none;
    export none;
  };
  graceful restart on;
  multihop 2;
  neighbor 169.254.169.254 as 64515;
  password "solarwinds123";
}
```

Let's say you'd like to see all UPDATEs that match a specific ASN `15169`. First, let's run a `bgpipe` proxy that listens on port `1790` and connects to the upstream router with TCP-MD5 when its client connects.

```json
$ bgpipe \
  -- connect --wait listen --md5 "solarwinds123" 169.254.169.254 \
  -- stdout -LR --if "as_path = 15169" \
  -- listen localhost:1790
2025-07-11 09:16:47 INF listening on 127.0.0.1:1790 stage="[3] listen"
```

Now let's reconfigure the BIRD instance to connect to `bgpipe` instead of the upstream router. Change the `neighbor` line in the BIRD configuration to point to `localhost:1790`:

```
// ...
protocol bgp vultr
{
  // ...
  neighbor 127.0.0.1 port 1790 as 64515;
  // password ""; // no password needed
}
```

Finally, restart your BIRD instance and you should see `bgpipe` reporting new connections, followed by JSON representations of BGP messages matching your filter:

```json
2025-07-11 11:23:45 INF connection R_LOCAL = 127.0.0.1:1790 stage="[3] listen"
2025-07-11 11:23:45 INF connection R_REMOTE = 1.2.3.4:36297 stage="[3] listen"
2025-07-11 11:23:45 INF connected 127.0.0.1:1790 -> 1.2.3.4:36297 stage="[3] listen"
